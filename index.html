    <!--To anyone who grades this homework: this code dosen't work, it's terrible I need help with javascript. 
I'm still waiting for the tutoring people to get back to me, but until then, I will continue to
come in early and stay late and do 1 on 1's and work with Khan Academy to get this stuff ingrained 
into my head. -Neil 

Pseudo Code:
At game start, computer will choose a random number thats to be displayed 
on UI. In addition, four crystal image buttons, each randomly assigned
a number by the computer, along side an entry field that displays a number
when the user clicks one of the crystals. The idea is to match the number exactly
that the computer has already displayed in a separate "Match this Number" field (box),
this field box records the numbers and add them up as the USER selects them. The idea is
to match the computer selected number exactly without going over in order to win. If USER
goes over, USER instantly loses. This will involve IF STATEMENTS, MATH.FLOOR or MATH.CELING as 
well as For loops

    <p>You will be given a random number at the start of the game.</p>
    <p>There are four crystals. By clicking on a crysal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.</p>
    <p>You win the game by
        <strong>matching</strong> your total score to the random number.
    </p>You lose the game if your total score goes above your random number.</p>
    <p>The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.</p>
    <p></p>Each crystals value will change anew randomly at the start of each new game. Good luck!</p>
